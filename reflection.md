- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance helps make coding a lot easier especially when things are coming from the same family. I think it is a very helpful tool. Extendeding things was very simple and the using "super" made sense. I had some trouble with the restocking in the cafe. I would tell someone in the future to carefully read through the read me file and look at the docs provided to aid with things like hashtables.
